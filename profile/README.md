# Corticon Decision Management
[Progress Corticon](https://www.progress.com/corticon) enables the users most familiar with complex policy rules, whatever the domain or industry, to author and test that application logic without coding. 



## Components of Corticon

Corticon is broken out into **rule definition** and **rule execution** components.

1.  Rules are designed, logically analyzed, documented, sequenced, and tested in **[Corticon Studio](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-quick-reference/page/A-guide-to-Progress-Corticon-Studio.html)**, along with any configurations for accessing/operating upon external datasources.

Rules are then either:

2) **[Corticon Server Deployment](https://docs.progress.com/category/corticon-java)**: Deployed as stateless decision services on a Corticon Server, exposed as web services or embedded within a Java application.
3) **[Corticon.js Deployment](https://docs.progress.com/category/corticon-javascript)**: Transpiled into a self-contained JavaScript bundle, runnable wherever JavaScript is supported.
