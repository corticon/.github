# Progress Corticon Decision Management

[Progress Corticon](https://www.progress.com/corticon) enables domain experts to author, test, and deploy complex, explainable business rules without coding and run them anywhereâ€”on servers, in clouds, serverless, browsers, mobile, and IoT. This page provides sample rule projects and demos for both Corticon Classic and Corticon.js.

## Getting Started

1. **Author Rules** in [Corticon Studio](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-quick-reference/page/A-guide-to-Progress-Corticon-Studio.html) or [Corticon.js Studio](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-js-quick-reference/page/A-guide-to-Progress-Corticon.js-Studio.html).
2. **Explore Sample Repos** (see below) and import rule projects into your studio.
3. **Deploy**: Package a Decision Service to Corticon Server/Web Console (Classic) or build a JS bundle for browser, Node, or serverless (Corticon.js).
4. **Integrate**  via REST/SOAP, embedded Java/.NET, or JavaScript function calls depending on target runtime.
